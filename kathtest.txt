You should've spent it better.
Lol. You guys fucked up on your comms budget
#rekt
You and lyft spend upwards of 8 million to get prop 1 passed. And lost out to a campaign only funded by about 170k.
Yah you guys could've been like
Probably a combination of lack of market study, bad pr team, bad ad team and arrogant legal team.
Lol
We host a concert for you for 8 mil, please vote for us k
Lol. It was a joke. But it's more about the fact that you guys didn't get to know the Austin market and realize the things that sway their voting patterns. #1 of which is support of local businesses and ecosystems
This convo color actually works nicely for Lyft.
Lol
Do you work out at a gym?
🐫
Oh I want to work out but idk how to do anything but cardio

No he doesn't but he should
Can you guys bring guests?
Hmm can I join you next time? I'm super weak and pathetic right now but I want to get stronger and at least learn a routine I can do on my own
All nights for now except Wednesday. I'm prioritizing gym rn.
Can you find out if your gym allows guests? I know that with my rate I pay, I can bring 1 guest at a time
Maybe tomorrow?
Let me know if there's a time that works for you this week!
Sure. How much is your membership?
Hmmm ok. Hopefully I can just learn from you on Thurs
We'll both die
Uhhh I can't save you from weights
K Thursday. Let's do it 💪
Um when do you get off work?
Uhhh I'd prefer to do smth before 8 but let me know what works best for you since you're the one doing me the favor
Oh okay. 7 sounds good for me. It'll give me time to walk over

LOL the regular smiley is so DERP
The smile one is like that dog in the chemistry lab
Hahahah
:)
Hahaha. I like the chemistry one the most
I'm scared of stuff in the air lol. I don't have a fear of heights I don't think, but I'm scared of like sky diving or space
Lol you know what I mean.
I think for me it's the danger. I'm not an adrenaline person. Like I don't like fast cars. I like slow cars lol. But I did like the fast and furious movies.
Wait no. I like roller coasters. And I like speed boats. Those don't feel as dangerous to me.
Okay but like space scares me to the core - like deep ocean exploration does. Sor thing about the dark and being trapped and confined under all that pressure.
I don't want to die lol.
HEY. HEARD YOU SKIPPED WORK TODAY HUH?
*?
Lol are you still going to the foundry tonight!
O. No pressure. I was just asking for Calvin. I don't want to go to the Foundry that bad haha so we most likely won't go if no one else does
Chinese food Friday?

My female compadres either are out or only eat chicken.

Ohhh
But I haven't put in th time to diagnose it
That sucks though. I'm pretty sure my power supply or something has an issue
Yeah but it's the time thing 😞
Idk
But all my drivers are fine
I'm not sure it's psu, but I keep getting power state driver failures
Tacky
Lol
*for?
Also - what do you use your PC force
I had to reformat my laptop recently. It sucked and now I have two operating system files and no idea how I did that or how to fix it lol
Ohhh
So you have really nice gpu then
Yeah lol - I have 650Ti - it can do everything
Wow
I'm only ordering parts through a shop like Fry's
If I go back to Texas or smth
Yeah
*mobo
Plot twist - it wasn't
My first mobile was listed as compatible with my other parts
Lol
Cuz then no wait time and they're responsible if something goes wrong in your hardware
And their service team is really good
Fry's has a really good stock
Oh. Idk. Idk if they have fry's here. I don't trust Best Buy
So if smth is damage you can just drive there and swap it
Oh...well that's the point though. That in TX gets has a lot in stock
And you can pick parts for them to build it for you
I can't find the second link
After the apt you said you liked
Wait what was the apt you sent me
Lol wtf this is in ny
Hey if you know anyone else cool at Uber looking for roommates - lmk

He seems ok
Haha it's slightly
Haha

Yeah
Which sucks since he initially agreed on 2.7k when he showed me the place
But we had to increase the price by 100 a month
😕
He just said he needed more time otherwise to think about it
He didn't give a reason
So we had to come up and match
I'm betting his other candidates were offering more
Yeah
Yeah. Well I don't think we'll have drama
And it's a good place
I mean I understand. But I think it's our only option
Thank Ryan
Lol
We don't really have another option now
And I dont think hes a bad person per se
But our rooms are far apart
True

Have you ever asked him
That's pretty cool.
No way.
Wow!
Oh wow really?
Look in his history
Oh I know a good way
Has he ever said a girl is pretty or hot or whatever?
Like maybe he just hasn't been close enough to anyone to feel that way
Mmm I think you can
Web browsing history lol
Idk
More than once
Has he ever watched porn
Idk why would he not tell you
Yeah but
Food
IN YOUR ROOM
Is Ryan a virgin? Maybe he's shy about it
That might be it
But
Don't get me wrong, it's totally cool to be asexual
Maybe he's just a little not-confident
Well that's probably it then
Ohhh
Like what usually happens there
Yeah I didn't think so
Do girls not hit on him?
Hmm
Ew do I want to hear this
What
LOL
Like does he just reject girls that confess to him?
Pics
Wait
Haha well I mean that's not surprising
Maybe she's not his type
She's not my type tho
Oh. I think I saw y'alls pics
Anyway
My type
The girl in front
(She's married but shhhhh)
Or interested
Ask Ryan if he thinks she's pretty
Wait
What how!!! She's the most beautiful girl
No - to interested
This girl I knew from sorority
Wait he said no?!
She's a kindergarten teacher
She has a beautiful heart
Omg he's sensitive
And pure
Super kind
Really into smiling, dogs, sports.
Ok
So he said no?
He thought I was trying to set him up w someone lol
He asked if I knew anyone who wanted a headshot
T________T
And he said "oh is it the friend you're trying to set me up with"
And I said my friend does (talking actually about a friend)
I WANT TO KNOW NOW
LOL no
Ask him about porn
You have to do it

If a girl asked you that, you'd probably think she has some sort of problem
Lol how

We're still going lol. One game got real long and real intense
Getting drunkkkkkk
If you would be coming to girls, is there anyone else you'd like to come along?
I'm just trying to get a sense of if this group will be like 4 or 6+.
Yeah sure I don't know them that well
Not like 10+ people inv
But sure
Yeah maybe! Maybe not like too many lol
V v v like
But sure!
Yeah I don't think I've met her
Ok. Anyone else? If we have a really big group, it might be better for getting a nicer Airbnb, but also cars will be an extra cost so I'm trying to budget things based off an estimate
Not to banff
He should come
Ryan is lame too
Lame
Lol why
Ok cool!!!
Have you been to girls?
Yeah bc it's hard to eat at small places or coordinate
Also I don't want like a group of too many
Yeah....
Yeah me too. I want to go to a real luau
And eat poke
Yeah I want to hula
Oh I went last year. Idk. I didn't have a good time. Idk if I'm a rave person. People kept elbowing me in the head and I had a fever.
Do you get hurt during raves? Is that normal?
Hope it's not violent like Blink 182
I can't wait for Simple Plan
That's intense
LOL
Hahah
Oh lol
>.> he should go even if I don't go
Hi did you ask robin and his boo
Oh yeah
An you let them know I invited so I'm not a creep
Hey so robin says it will depend on his work if he can go to girls. So IDK if this will go through D:
ah yeah
so he needs like a week or two to find out
D':
maybe $150
it's like a $100 difference or so
but I guess for people who are a bit richer
they're like the cheapest of the year right now
Thats what I'm worried about.
or er $450
like $500 round trip
is that expensive? Should I warn people
yeah - it's actually one of the cheapest times of year. No idea why.
oh probably bc there aren't holidays
LOL
Ew
What's next weekend
Womp womp
Oh I did not get an invite lol
Nooo
Yeah idk
Lol no that's so rude!

Ouch. 2fast2dangerous
Did you get in Tahoe?
Are you doing galantis?
What's Nicky Romero
A lot
People selling tickets on the page rn
Ah I think Calvin and I were gonna go to galantis
Aw ok
💀
I am scared to die
I've never been
Is it pricey?
Ahhh I would say no lol. But maybe it's bc I was traumatized by snowboarding. I like water sports.
Oh it's an overnight thing?
Ok I'm in
Ooh! That sounds fun.
How will everyone get there?
Oh. Can I call dibs in someone's car? I'm poor.
Hey for the ATV thing, when is it? Like when will everyone leave and come back?
What's special about this one
When y'all going?
Are you dressing up
Yeah Polk is going to be crowded but I would be down
Oh that's early 😞 we have to stop by a friend's gathering first
You did that?!
What
Weird lol. I might go by Daiso later. I don't really have green clothes
Not green enough
Do more
Why don't you do half and half
Do you not have work today btw?
It will look cooler
O
Lol
Btw do you see Calvin rn?
It's gonna be packed!
Looks business-y
Does it have an inviting atmosphere to get ratchet in?
You at Ava?
No we just got to our friends
Y'all there already?
You still there?
Do you want us to come? Do you hate everyone?
Maybe we come now!
Where's churn
Whete are y'all
You DONT KNOW
JASONNNN
No
WHERE
We' can come to you
Let's go out ok?
It's 11
Why you left
Jason don't sleeeeeep
Hey, just as a heads up I don't think Calvin will make it to Connie's thing 😞 he seems like he's not feeling well.
What
New York!
Ok you wanna eat NY pizza in 30 mins?
You are one day late
I'm worried about this weekend. I got sick tonight 😞
Flatiron
No that much I think. Only like $75 a day or so?
I'm try but I'm on a business trip lol. So  traveling back tomorrow. V v v not rest
How much can you guys spend?
lol nice
So it's not bad
NY food is more affordable and yummy than SF though
I already ate but I went to a Congee place bc I was sick. I wanted to explore SoHo but it's like 20 degrees out and sick.
Ah
Do you know NY well?
I love this city! Very pretty :)
If I could eliminate just the danger element though SF would be fine
Yeah... same lol
A hobo grabbed Jenn by the necklace
:(
in SF?
Way safer than SF
I think all major tech companies have huge offices here though right?
...mehh
9th?
Your guys' street is a bit scary though
I didn't see
Ohh
Really?
Jesus...
Omg. Like threaten another crazy person or someone walking by on the street?
But I'm glad there are people brave enough to do so
That seems like a terrible idea
I would never try to pull apart a knife fight
What time were you planning on leaving today?
Can we push it back a bit? Or are we coordinating times with another group
I'm still a little sick 😕 should I still be going?
Or 5:30 is fine. I'm mostly concerned whether it's being inconsiderate if I go or not now 😞
Are we going to go through a drive through then?
Ok. Sorry in advance for blowing my nose very often
Ok
Can I borrow your Costco card sometime
Do you eat ribs every week
Ooh for work?
I'm in girls the weekend after but in May - yeah!
Yay! Thanks! Ok
Oh what company

I have pretty bad memory when I drink
Haha
He accepted my request just now
LOL apparently I added this guy too
Hey are you going to dinner with that guy we met at the bar
Lol
Oh
But I guess he found us all on FB? Haha
I don't think I even talked to the guy
Yeah lol now
Well this should be interesting. I wonder who's all going
He said Jason Libby's team
Yeah I heard
And I'm horrible at meeting people at bars
Yeah I guess I just don't really remember talking to other people Saturday so I was a bit surprised.
Wait what the heck was that photo
The barf with popcorn or something? Calvin got it on Snapchat. I didn't
Oh
Really?
Wow
💯👌
2sexy4me
🎃
Heppy job day
🎃
Hey would you be down for dim sum tomorrow actually? I want to plan something but I don't know how many people will be free since bay to breakers
No worries! Everything worked out :)
We just did Bay to Breakers instead! Calvin went with his group of friends and I went with mine. It was pretty cool. I've never been before.
Yeah lol. I went as Nick from Zootopia
None lol. My friends took the photos
Are those the tickets?
So pretty
Sunday night - plans?
Is congay - company?
Oh boo. I'm only free Sunday night. There's a free play night at coin-op
That sounds like a shitty airline lol
Does Connie hate me? Just wondering. Bc I was going to see if she wanted to get coffee
I don't think she does
Idk. Bad first impressions?
Test the waters before swimming or something something
But I don't know that she likes me. So I just wanted to check.
Good.
Well for Connie I think it's different because we've met before and different events but haven't talked much
Yeah but like....girls.
Sweet
100%
I will take it as she hates me
Home
Omg I had the same tiny ketchup yesterday
Weekend plans?
I have no plans 😛
Oh lol I was going to ask if I could borrow your Costco card
Yeah I think so 😞
It's okay though!
But that's why I asked. I was going to see if you were going to Costco and I could tag along lol
Uhhh lol
Might not work out that way.
Lol we broke up a bit ago
It's ok! We're still good. I just don't have anyone to split costs with now for Costco 😛
I think the only bad part is it's been awk telling people since we have mutual friends and we had all these events that we still went to together.
I'm hopefully moving out in July.
Just like a few weeks ago.
Just didn't work out. I think we're not the best people for each other.
But we're still good friends so all's good. :)
Still in SoMA but I think I have a place lined up
Why do you know someone with an opening?
LOL. Too much $$$$ for me
With private bath hopefully :)
The place I'm looking at is $1400
How much do you guys pay?
Yeah lol I figured.
By LinkedIn :) super great location too.
I've had my eye on his place for like the past few months lol
Ian lives there now, so that's how I knew about it
Oh really? I thought your new office was by Uber
No I think like 4
Haha maybe. I have a lot of client meetings next week, so I have lots of free lunch
Oh yeah. I've eaten at one. It was ok lol.
Ok now no excuses to invite me for free lunch.
Yeah
Yeah he was a dude
Haha let's do next next week then
Also - your friend who came to your party - who is the business analyst?
Maybe though! Like Friday?
Cool.
Would it be weird if I reached out to him for coffee? I've been wanting to talk to someone again in that role
🎃
Are you camping today?
Are you going out tonight w ppl?

Here let me find one real quick
It makes it blue.
That they will guarantee match
It just shows
Sorry my Elo is low rn. I think it's bc I haven't been on Tinder for very long
See?
Yah
So you feel better or are like flattered and might swipe right more likely
Have you been on a tinder date before?
Yah. Well I've swiped on ones that seem nice and have blue even if I'm not interested to elo boost safely
It's nice if the guy seems nice
Rough
O dang
Is it awk?
I want to see your profile now to evaluate
Hahaha
I saw a really clever one from a guy recently. Instead of like ENFJ or whatever, his was PBNJ

Hahaha
But hello
Ok don't be sad - I'm going to nope you bc I don't want you to see my tinder profile anymore

And put more pics of yourself
I think that's fine
Get Ryan to take them!
What makes a girl boring?
Ahh I see. Dating is so complicated
Are you going to LA?
Ok so we all can just go out? Bc my coworkers want to get champagne and fries now and I'm just trying to plan around everyone's things.
>.>.>.>
Ok I don't think I can go to Costco Friday 😞
Which is why I asked
Lol.
My coworkers want to get champagne and fries
But we can potentially meet y'all afterwards if you're going out
But Aki is out of town
Oh. Yes I can go Saturday

And windows all around it
Yeah, but still no walls and no closet
Well it's hard to have so many curtains to block light but yeah
I'm still open to it
Since I have no alternative lol
Ah. I see
LOL
Does Ava have gym?
Ah that's ok though.
Ah well I wasn't sure how well they covered out that much light
Oh. I thought that was public gym
Well I'm trying to stay positive about it. What're yalls utilities like?

Lol - that's pretty cool! But it's so pink!!
Do you like it?
Omg!!! Wait so it will be like this even after EDC?

Man - I'm not a rave person but edm festivals seem so fun with all the colors and dressing up
My meds make me really dizzy and my face hurts when I walk.
I feel slightly drunk oddly enough
My doctor says yesterday and today should be the worst and that it should get better from here
But on meds for the next week
I'm surprised how quickly I lost consciousness tbh.
I don't remember it actually. They iv'd me and then I went out and just woke up after.
Did you say you haven't had yours pulled?
That's a trap
I know you're a cheater
What're you doing for pride parade btw? Does your company have a float?
Oh - well I'm trying to get a group together so lmk
Does this guy look 28 to you?
He looks 40
Oh I didn't even notice that
I feel so bad for people on OkCupid. They call me out when I don't respond
Apparently that's not their algo anymore
lol it's okcupid
My tinder elo is too low now
I can't use that account
LOL that's mean
Your first few days you have a boost to determine rank

Shhhhh
🎃
What're you doing after work today?
But that's ok I'll ask Allan lol.
No worries! Have fun drinking away his worries
Ah ok. I was thinking of going to Costco to get stuff for dolo on Sat
😮 Wow
Woooo
Booooo
Jason. The heck man.
Did you ok it?
I thought you were being an instigator
No it's fine. We cool.
Ok
I love match making
But I'm not very good at it.
No one here lol. I don't know enough girls
And girls here are too precious
Though your friend steph is real cute
Like just. I love them all and I done want them to be hurt
Maybe you should invite more girls to your things 😉
Yah that makes sense
I wish. I'm trying to meet more girls
But a lot of girls I meet are taken so....yeah. Which is totally cool. For me.
You're special
What do you mean?
To be nice.
Show me a pic
Girls are WAYYY more harsh about girl looks than guys
Oh lol. They're lying.
You guys all said she was cute too
Um, I've done it like once recently lol.
I don't think I did it to you
I did it to Jason Libbey lol (don't tell him)
Yeah lol
But to be fair
His bumble date
Yeah
Like do you remember the girl in the black like bralette/bustier he showed us?
And I was like "oooh"
I think like "cute" might be a lie a lot of the times
Like when we went to that bar in Chinatown
But then he showed me her pic again this past week
Sometimes she's just cute
LOL
But cute doesn't always mean it's a lie
"Really pretty" is like honest
At least for me
Girls say like subtle things to say you're ugly
Also - I feel like guys take way more selfies than girls
You take a lot of selfies lol
Or bc you're drunk
LOL
O true
What is
🐙
O
LOL
Uhhhhh
It went really well. But now he's being a bit weird
Bc I had a little to drink and was too friendly
So....idk. It's weird now. But the date was good.
Yeahhh
I like strongly told him to tone it down lol
But yeah I didn't realize it would be offputting to me
Yeahhhhhh
Idkkk
Like....and I think he like indirectly, jokingly said he loved me yesterday but I didn't think anything of it
Bc we were drinking and people say stupid shit when they drink
Bc we're sober now
lol like it was kind of sweet
Like how it slipped out
But now it's like....too much
Lol yeah
Idk like he's super nice but i think it's my fault too bc I'm too friendly and open and don't know how to first date
Lol what
Yeah but like in bits and pieces
Btw are you doing anything this Friday?
I'll tell you later lol.
LOL.
Oh lol!
Well it wasn't like that.
I think Allan and I were going to try to do a board game thing maybe
Nope lol.
Oh have fun!

Aw ok
East bay is kind of north
No?
No it's right across the bridge
Lol ok
So I'll just like Bart there tomorrow morning
And you don't need to go to east bay haha
Yah but I don't want to take you out of the way lol
I was going to maybe get IKEA to ship it? Idk.
Idk. But I guess I could UberXL
Oh I like your plan.
I thought you had a thing tomorrow though, no?
Dude that thread
Last minute
It was kind of last minute but honestly I don't like when people decide things last min either lol
And no one responded to my bar question lol
I think he just doesn't like when people change plans
I think it's fine. I just don't want him to be upset though
Well I'm like not down for tonight nown
I can make today
That's why I asked earlier lol.
Yeah
Yeah
But no one gave a time or place
So it's a bit last minute if I were to go out.
Bc I need to plan an outfit
Well I think he wanted to do today bc that house party?
Thick?
🐎
Lol
Like THICC
It's not it's just inconvenient lol. Bc now Calvin and I are going to eat food
Omg
I msged
Your message overkill lol
I just don't want Aki to feel like we're ganging up on him
*thjng
Jason
Lol
No it's not a taking the fall thigh
I don't think it seems like you're arbitrarily doing it
It makes sense why you ask
*are
Lol
Yeah. His message was a little pa sorry
I think it will be fine.
Jesus Aki
Idk. I just don't want it to be the three of us if Aki is mad lol
Ok but like technically I don't know that it's supposed to be a small group eighth
*right?
Ok yeah maybe
I'm just really nervous about making people upset
Idk. Ok
Lol dude
I don't mind caring lol, I just have to mitigate it a lot. Having more people in a group usually gets morale up lol
Yeah I get it for work.
Yah true
Wait did you go to Costco today?
WITHOUT MEEEE

I just didn't make the connection.
Lol yeah.
I knew the bear was from Costco too

Hey do you possibly have time this week to help me drive some stuff to AVA?
Like Tuesday?
Oh ok yay. What time do you get off?
Saturday?
Lolll
Ah ok. I'm like trying to schedule a task rabbit for my stupid curtains. So 7:30 is fine! I'll let you know if they cancel on me lol.
Thanks so much!!!
No, you pay ppl by the hour
It's different from person to person
Do you need referral code?
They set it upfront and you pick people
https://www.taskrabbit.com/r/3m2a3/try
Yeah
Yah they can do a bunch of things, even like wait in line lol
I like the reviews too
Yeah
Just moving!
It's a bit too pricey for anything else I want
Or like - if you need a personal assistant for a day
But you can hire for cleaning too
Yah you really need a task
Yeah. There are use cases where it would be bunnyficial.
Ikr. I thought of it and had to seize the hopportunity.
You have an aBUNdance of poor jokes.
So conflicted...
The pig is so cute but 9gag....
*though
Lol what is that subreddit thoigh
#repost
Why do you have so many subreddits lol
With just your posts
U/razor_storm lol
Your post history
Yah
Ok will do
#planned
Yes
$1 per lie. $10 and up for each that have compromising real life implications.
I can tell you a half lie for a sample but that's all.
I may or may not have a fear of boomerangs
Ok. But don't be nervous if it's not good as mine. I charge for professional services for a reason
#triggered
What do? Ignore? Reply? Apologize?
Like I feel bad but like...he wasn't very nice in person
I responded one line
And got two texts
Ughhhhh
I fucked up
Maybe I shouldn't have haha'd
Ok
Man I feel so bad
Idkkkk
Should I say smth though?
Just be like "hey, I don't think this will work out. Sorry"?
But I think you're right
Oh really?
Really? Ah ok
I just don't understand what happened
Man I suck
And that it was mutual
Like I thought things went POORLY
They're just awkward and bad at communicating right?
For what. It was date 1....
There's no way right? Like people aren't actually like that
Like. I don't think it would've been that bad if he wasn't so rude right up front
Like opening with "oh yeah drinks here suck"
$15 actually
I had too many heavy boxes
Also - I am hiring movers for today, so thank you for your help, but I think I will be good!
Nah. But i do like some people more than I hate camping.
Idk like $60 tentatively 😞
But it saves hassle I gues
Yeah 😢
Yosemite is so intense lol
Lol look at this PSA from Bumble
Not on bumble lol
Ok mom
😬
Man I can't do it but change our group emoji to that
Do you have to pay still?
What's the etiquette
Btw if a guy asks you to a sushi dinner
Or do you say "I can't swing that"
Yas
Date
😬
But you are too poor for sushi rn
Cool.
Can you just run my tinder for me
Omg. That would be such a fun experiment.
I want to do that
So we'd have to run a test with two people who we feel have similar flirting capabilities
I think I'm an above average flirter
Idk. I think so.
I think I kind of ugly duckling'd
Omg yes
How to determine flirting capability?
Self assessment?
High school
So I dated even when guys actively told me I was ugly
So I think I'm good at flirting then
California and China lol
I have multiple data points confirming my unattractiveness
Lol
Well. Southern Chinese girls are prettier 😉
But lol nah I went to international school.
😬
So Korean, Chinese and American guys have all told me I'm ugly
Lol this is a pretty bad one
But like lol. I still dated guys.
LOL
I lost my baby fat, fixed my skin a little, that's it actually lol
I think I don't look that different lol. But acne is rough
lol it's not that different!
But yeah. So that's why I think I'm a good flirter
Hm. Idk.
Well idk.
I think I have game. Like just a little
Oh
Lol. If I really had game
I would be able to salvage a bad situation
But I get really nervous around certain guys
Like only like 2 guys I think
Do you get nervous?
Like you know when you build someone up in your head - then I'm like die
But otherwise I'm good.
Oh same. But I'm also shy.
That makes sense
Hmm I never know people I have a crush on very well
Oh like people I'm really close to, I don't try to look cute or act cute
I'm like obnoxiously loud and whatever about things
Maybe it's bc I hobo around my friends a lot
College sweetheart
Maybe. Idk.
That's a good story tho
Do itttt
Camille is pretty
Oh Felby
But I kind of have the feeling that everyone is in love with Felby. She's so cute
Or that other girl
But actually no. I like having her as a friend
Camille.
Idk I would be. She's so nice :3
That other one
I forget her name
Dude Camille then
Ah! Yvana
Picky.
Like super super picky lol.
I feel like I've rejected a lot of guys for that reason.
Personality wise yeah
lol that's like a lot of guys
Yeah. But like, I think I have higher standards for that.
Like. I want someone with a far better personality than me. Who I can admire as a person lol.
And like, they might think they've like made it already by then.
And realize they're not up to my niceness standard.
Like I feel bad, bc when I'm into a guy, it's SUPER OBVI. Like I straight up ask stupid stuff like "are you single" or ask them out. And then I come to my senses
But you know those things about someone only after a some time.
And if he seems kind and we share a sense of humor
Idk. Like if I think he's cute. But apparently that's arbitrary according to my friends
Well like, my ex, we hit it off bc our humor just like melted together
But people weren't always nice about how he looked, but I thought he was like the most attractive guy ever
Well there's either tension or there's not
Yah
Usually though I know like within meeting a person for the first time if I'm going to crush on them or not lol
Bc I'm a middle schooler
But like when you think about "which girls do I not want to trip and fall in front of"
Ah.
Yeah...that's hard though.
Like I don't think there's anyone in SF even platonically I've met where it's been like with my ex.
It's mostly like polite humor haha
Humor is nice but it's hard to find lol.
There's an ex. Like THE ex, you know?
Yeah. Lol.
I saw him again for the 4th. It was rough
Oh no lol.
It's been 2+ years
But man. I still cry at songs bc of him lol.
When did you get the Invisalign? Recently?
But your teeth weren't bad were they?
Oh wow
😬
Oh really? Yeah no idea
Just 10? EZ GAEM EZ LIFE
Lol
Man.
Nervous.
I was thinking of maybe doing it next week. Or next next week. But idk.
Should I ask that guy out?
lol the former
Why would I be nervous for some tinder guy
What?
This is how I know hype men work
Lol well I don't know him
Allan keeps hyping him.
I've been hung out with him
Ahhhh don't hype him.
Yeah. I guess that's what I want to see.
Allan hyped the nice part
Are drinks too forward?
I've never been on a day thing before so idk how coffee dates work
I already did that
Didn't work
How do I got about it?
Lol
Yeah I know right. I think he would tio
But like I have this false hope bc we talked a long time ago
But vlejfhaiksnfb
I should just do it and get it over with
Yeah also it super sucks bc I have the feeling he's not nice actually
You're right
K. Next week.
Lol
No it's ok. I'm probably being creepy.
Wow
Yeah true.
Ok ty love coach
I get ittttt
I uglyyyyy
Lolllll so rudddee
For me
I need a hype crew
But people don't help me. They sabotage me. Like Allan.
I don't need spy cam
I need hype men
V v v rude
Ok. No more. Zip.
Are you free tomorrow btw?
I don't think I'll be able to get my PC over tonight with movers.
Yay
Thank you!
😬
Can I come eat tomorrow?
Sweeet
How do I book the elevator in AVA?
I don't think I have one yet
Ooh thank you!
Can I still drive into the loading dock?
Ooh no today
Where is that?
Where else is parking?
Sorry can I call you real quick?
How do I get in from there?
Ah ok
Your phone zzzz
???
Pic?
They're on their way btw
Me too
Rude
Whyyy
Lol what
Someone said you guys were talking about me at Uber.
Is that true?
Hey. I heard some shit
It must've been at your dinner
When you visited
And we just fought about it right now
I just want to make sure it's just like joking because Calvin overhead you guys
😕 ok.
It's just kind of shitty because he made it seem like y'all were being super loud about it
And he made it seem like a LOT of people I knew, knew
😕 I guess I'm just upset because he made it out to be like something else
Idk.
What
No like you guys wouldn't have talked about someone being interested in me, or whatever
Y'all wouldn't have said anything like that if Jason was around right?
Or about me even, if he was around?
Oh. But he wasn't there, right?
Ok.
Ok.
I'm just kind of stressed out since Calvin made it seem like something more intense than Connie joking
Yeah, I mean it's not only that I guess
Yeah...
Bc there's stupid shit going on that I don't know about
I just don't want to be put in an awk spot where I can't be friends with people
I guess he said Allan and Alex said similar things
I'm sorry. It's just what Calvin said made it seem like several of his coworkers were talking about me dating
Yeah..:
Ok. Yeah sorry. I don't want it to be a big deal if it isn't.
Ah ok.
I'm just being like nervous
Please don't tell anyone that I heard anything from Calvin
Man. Sorry to like
Bring this up to you
Which is just a gross feeling...
That, or that someone was "going after me" which made me feel just really awful.
Because it's so nice hanging out with everyone.
But Calvin kind of made it seem like people were only hanging out with me to
Yeah basically set me up with someone
Did you pass your interview?
Yeah. It made me super sad honestly to think about.
Yeah.
Ughhhhh
Sorry.
Yeah it's most just...thinking that people don't genuinely want me to be around, except to get with someone they know
Which is dumb when I type it I guess, but that's kind of what I was thinking
Oh that's good.
I just feel bad for him
And we UberEATS'd
And then fought
Yeah. I probably should have
Calvin came over bc he wanted to help me unpack
Idk.
I might as well be ballsy this week so all the suck happens and next week can be betters
*better
Ugh. This week. Has just been the shittiest ever.
Ughhh
Previously
Allan told me he doesn't want to make things troublesome at work
So.
Bc Calvin
But idk, if it seems like, I am also being like an uber slut SOMEHOW. Idk.
Ugh
Mk. Sorry I feel like I bombarded you with messages today.
I owe you one
Good night
Haha thanks
You should do before and after pics!
Quick - take one of your teeth before the Invisalign works
Now
You don't know how fast it can work today
Dude - you meeting up with Calvin today?
This weeeeeeek
Ughhhhhhh
Who?
Yeah ofc not
I love this emoji
And the way it shakes when you hold it is perfect
Like Jedi?
What's a force press
😬
Lie
😬
It's my favorite
Yayyy
Where
Wait why are you at Twitter?
Ooh
We still on for food and move?
Maybe not dinner and I'll meet you?
I have a pizza
Nah i need to go home and get stuff ready i think.
Just lmk when you can make it over!
There's a loading area in front of my building! Like on Folsom
8?
Now?
Oh sorry lol.
Is later better?
I'm super flexible
Ok lmk!
When you're hete
Can you park there or no? I forget
Ah perfect!
Yeah come up
Or I can come get you f you can't come in
Oh ok
I come now
Give me all her pics
LOL I have so many bad ones
Lol but it means she has a cute dog
"I have a hard time imagining you could ever be cuter in person than you are in your 3rd pic."
Like if the dog photo is #3
Unnmm
Not that I can think of right now lol
😬
Yah lol
I can deliver today
I'm abnormally nervous today
HAVE FUN
Ohhh you need it before?
Oh lol ok
Help me with wording
Did that girl respond btw?
Yeah
If he doesn't respond I'm blaming you
^literally me
😬
Lollllll
lol by this conversation, I already know he won't say yes
Guys can feel creeper vibes from like 100 miles away
What
What if he says yes
I'll cut my hair and wear your jacket
And go in your stead as "Kason"
I'm too nervous for that
The internet says I should strike up a convo first
But idk
"Hey - would you want to go grab drinks with me sometime?"
Omg but what's small talk?
Fuck
Duck.
Omg that's so awk
Omg helpppp
Is that awk?
Oh hey?
I need a professional
What if he flat out is like "hey, what's up"
O
I'm dying.
Where is your date tonight?
Like
Fuck that's so bad
I'm like embarrassed reading that
Hey Jason, how's it going?
Hey - so sorry this is a little out of the blue, but do you want to grab drinks with me sometime?
😬
I need a second opinion
*third
That's not a truth
"So I just saw (insert random coincidental thing here) which made me think of you and that one time (insert sneaky relevant story here). I'd like to catch up! Do you want to grab a coffee or lunch sometime?"
My friends advice
Then what do I say
UGH
?????
I feel like that's awk tho
Why?
I mean. He 100% knows I'm awk
Maybe I should just own up to my awkness
I feel like any way I do this will be awk
??? This then?!
Oops I didn't crop
Bc it's acknowledging how awk I'm being
Lol
Perfect text
Look at that
Ss?
Why lol
What
Omg LOL
no she was referring to my other text
The "out of the blue" one
What lol
I hate myself
Ty for your support
Hey, how've you been? It's been a while. I was wondering if you wanted to grab a drink some time and catch up.
Now you're being sarcastic
Omg you troll
Is it actually ok
Ok.
She's so smooth
I asked my coworker
And my coworkers said after 8 is slutty lol
So 7:53?
No it's more eloquent
Now is middle of work day
He's probably busy
7:53
Ok so like.
Hey! How've you been? It's been a while - I was wondering if you wanted to grab a drink some time and catch up.

Haha
Passing you some juju
When can I respond
Just bc I passed the phone screener
Bc now it's the interview
God. Thank you, Jason, for being so tolerant of my idiocy over this.
And bc I'm a creepy nerd, so I don't know how to manage my emotions over this whole thing.
*sigh*
Ok.
I calmed down a bit
Tyyyyyy
Btw - idk how this would ever come up, but can you keep it hush?
Thank you Jason <3
So I'm good
You da best
I'm assuming your date is over?
Bc I know Jason and Aki know...
Tyyy
Lol thanks
Ooh ok. I'll let you be. Goodnighttttt
How do you know when it's a date?
Also - I need bar suggestions.
Well lol
Idk if it's a date
What
lol that's dumb
It's fine if it's not a date
Lol gross
Bottom 20%
I'll just be myself
I'm just happy it's even happening
Omg Jason rude
Oh well not in this case
In this case I'm below average
It's finnnne
If it doesn't fly, it doesn't fly
I'm not acting like an "ugly" girl. I'm just, happy about it
It's Thursday
So I luckily have a lot of time
Lol
??
I didn't say a time.
Or place
Oh. I suggested Thursday
That's all that happened.
I have no idea where he lives
No idea what's good
^-^
Yeah haha it's like the only soma bar I know other than geek bars
I was thinking local edition just bc I know it and it's familiar....but it's also super crowded sometimes.
Like any other bar I haven't been to
Is it inconvenient though? Bc you can't just go in like, a t shirt
It's hard isn't it?
Oh lol
Did y'all get a table though?
Oh. I thought you had to reserve
Oh ok
So are y'all going to see each other again?
Ah
Did she feel that way too?
Oh.
Oh.
You should invite her to something!
😬
We're eating at Yamo which is cool
Wow that was a typo
It's a hole in the wall Burmese place?
Yeh
Should be super casual.
Yeyah
NO PARTY THIS TIME
He help people not dead
Yeah the previous one I was really just giving a shot
It's in the mission. Interesting choice, but I like the sound of it bc it's cheap lol
WOW
+this guy seems nice.
You can hit him up
Yes. He will prescribe one nap.
This guy is ok. Like 5.78/10
Ya if you ever feel dead
I'm a little worried bc I think he's tall
And I want to wear comfy shoes lol bc I have to bart there
Go pick it up at your local CVS
Ok I try
Actually that's prob fine
Calvin was like 5"11
Idk. Like. I don't want to feel like a midget
Idk. Maybe 6?
If he were 6, I would be in trouble
😬
It's the best
What's the weather like today? Warm?
Mk
I want to nap right now so bad
I'm home lol
It's ok. I will take an illegal nap
For 30 mins
Nooo
555 555 5555
Duck I have a client call
I want to nap
Lol
I wonder what I should wear to Yamo. Normally probably like a t shirt and jeans lol.
No people keep calling me
What do girls usually wear on dates w you?
What kind of shoes
LOL
Lol
And I'm like wat
True.
But what if he finds out
Like I'm faking something and he's like "actually...you have a tumor"
What shoes do they normally wear
Yeah
Mm I was actually wondering if you guys were free sometime tomorrow or Sunday
Hey are you and Ryan actually up to help me with curtains? I can buy you guys food. My task rabbits keep canceling 😢
If not, Monday night?
I'll ask Ryan too
Yeah that would be perfect!!!
I asked him indiv
I didnt know we had a group chat
Oh
I can't find any of my stuff
7:30
Getting ready now lol
lol I can't. Showering and stuff
Idk if he wants make move but I want
How to make move
What're you up to?
Man. It ended so weird.
But I thought it went really well...
Nothing happened in the end. We like. Took a Lyft together, it dropped me off and that was it
But then we went to a bar.
Oh really?
Ohhh
Idk. Shouldn't have something happened?
Like I don't think he tried to make any moves. But he could've ended the date at a point
Idk.
He sent
Like super vague.
Yeah. I'm like not sure I'll ever see him again.
But it sucks lol. I liked him.
Bc it's polite and he seems nice
And he doesn't really text me, so. Idk. It was a super awk ending
As a vague "maybe we will or won't"
I don't think that's making a plan
I always say "yeah let's hang sometime"
He was so nice.
I mean it wouldn't have worked bc he's a doctor
Blahhhhhh
Idk. Can just tell he is.
Idk. I think he seemed like he cared a lot about people.
Ok. Oh well.
Yeah maybe.
Yeah maybe I'm being bamboozled
LOL no not that
I think it's the latter
But like idk lol. I thought that a first date kiss would be nice.
But maybe I have no idea how dates should go
What's the cool thing to do
Should I text to check up? Or no?
Ty for the advice...your experience is so valuable
😬
I think most of the things you say make sense
I guess usually I just do whatever I want. But now in the adult world, it's not as cute to be that clingy
Trying not to be.
I think it's just I like talking and being around people a LOT. So. I think it's misconstrued as I'm obsessed with someone
Haha kind of unfortunately.
??
Yeah.
That makes sense
Wait what do you mean
Do something about it
Ohhh
Jason you too smart
I like that you seem pretty open with everything though
Haha yeah?
I'm glad we have that in common lol.
Bc y'all have a lot of HS friends or college friends?
LOL.
Aren't you are Ryan like that though?
Ah
Yeah I like the more socially open people
Ocean beach haha
Do you play
Going to play beach volleyball!

Oh can I come

Hey how late do you guys think you'll hang at AVA? Or are y'all going to bars later?
Ok I may or may not stop by
So.... :P
Depends on timing
Lol the guy I went out with wants to get dessert
He has a nerd vibe too.
I think he's pretty cute.
But he's super sweet
Yeah :)
It's kind of sad though bc I know it won't work out
And he lives/works in Sacramento, just lives in Oakland on the weekends.
So. Yeah.
He's really busy since it's his last year of residency. And he's interviewing for cardiology positions soon.

I feel like I should go visit and say bye to Allan since he's being an asshole and ignoring all my messages lately
To say hi to Allan. Hope to fucking god I don't run into Jason
>.>
But like fuck I was going to set the time and place tomorrow
Maybe I'll just go early

I'm out of practice but I used to be in art education :3
Ooh! I can help and practice with you.
I am pretty savvy (I guess more than avg person) in sketching I think .
Just practice lol.
Well I guess it depends on the kind of art you want to pursue
Ohhhh
Really old solid intuos
I used photoshop for digital
I can help with that too haha.
Though Allan has a Wacom he can sell you
But I think the most important thing is consistently drawing
Ah I did that. I do think it's helpful.
Yah
Trained in a lot of mediums.
College. I was almost an art education major lol
Ahh I can do acrylic paint a bit from training, but I also do chalk pastel.
I am shit at watercolors
I can also do paper models/balsa models
And a bit of welding/woodworking
Yeah since I was an architecture major and then I did a semester of 3D space sculpturing when I moved to art

Hmm, I feel like a van could fit it though.

That makes sens
She said they can fit in a smart car

Idk I guess it's up to you. We can all eat and split and let him know
Oh yeahhh
0 connection.
Waste of money. Spent $32
I am never offering to buy the first drinks again
Waste of time
Talked a lot about spaghetti
I'd actually prefer to just split and venmo
Idk. I just want to be nice.
But it's been awk to do it in the past
I don't want a guy to always pay bc then it feels like I owe him or smth
*i do
My guilt is greater than my sadness at the money loss
But yeah that sucked last night. I def ended it at the first chance I saw
Yeah....but I did
Yeah we took turns
But I think the second round drinks were cheaper
Idk.
I wonder how I should handle payment tonight
I think I'll just be like "oh no worries, I'll get my own"
Jason lol
Which I'm like strangely not as nervous about anymore
Like...I like the other guy a lot lol
Should I offer first then and close out
Take turns?
Yeah
Why
Mk. What if he doesn't think it's a date thing
Mk.
How did your date dress to local edition
How casual
What kind of shoes
Simple shirt
I have an outfit in mind but I don't want to seem too try hard
Local edition haha
Can I run my outfit by you today?
And let me know if it's too try hard
Lol yeah that was the plan
I can take a video. DONE.

It was just chill lol
Idk we'll see. If he asks me out again, we'll see
If he wants to try, we can try.
But it was fun just broing out
It's weird
But he paid for all my food and drinks
Yeah. Like maybe I'd rather have him as a friend
He doesn't look like his pics lol

Do you have plans
Omg lame
When are you back from Africa
Say hi to my parents for me
Angola
They look like me
But older
Yah when I get home
I draw for you
This guy kind of looks like you
Yeah
LOL
I didn't swipe
His bio is too work out-y
Yeah it's like "hobbies are workin out...lifting weights....outdoor workin out"
My tinder elo so bad now
And like 90% white guys
LOL
For you
Jk they're not
Bc Jason is 50% 😉
Lolll
Loll
My dad and my mom
😬
Holy shit dude
That's scary 😞
Do you browse /r/relationships?
I feel like that sub is depressing
Btw this was my first super like match on Tinder
2' 01" what a big cat
This is the best profile of my life
I should just delete all my other dating apps
I've found the one
I hope I don't scare them off
Oh lol. My profile
I'm so sad you're gone this Friday
I want to go get drinks. This week has sucked so hard and it's only Monday
*Tuesday
Just stuff. Like almost 70% bc of work. But then fighting with calvin, moving stuff, dating stuff.
But akis thing is sat so I feel like an alcoholic if I ask anyone this week
I want to go to a tiki bar
Yah
😕
Bc of my rent deposit
And I took a vacuum cleaner
It's dumb
Whatever.
About what
??
Yeah it's like I don't care anymore and I don't want to discuss out "relationship"
*our
But he wants to keep bringing shit up and it just pisses me off
Yeah he brings it up over things like me taking the vacuum and me wanting my rent deposit
Yeah but idk I think the relationship is more important to him
For me, it ended so long ago and there are just all these bad feelings
Idk.
But I'm just so bitter about the relationship
Yeah you're right
I feel really shitty for not caring that he's sad
Yeah.
Idk if his past relationships were like this
Like we dated over a year and a half
It's my fault bc I think I sucker people into these relationships
And that's sometimes a deal to people
But it's nbd to me.
And it's rough bc like...
Idk I didn't love him really.
Like I've only been in love with one person and that relationship still wrecks me. So I feel bad that I'm not more sympathetic to Calvin.
It's the denial portion
You know? Like you don't want to believe it's going to be gone and over
Not every one
I didn't really get hurt intensely until I was a junior in college
Before then the breakups were meh
Man you had some intense high school dating haha
Yeah I agree
It's fine. I just don't want to argue with him anymore
I just feel like I'm being unreasonably mean sometimes. He just brings out the worst in me
True
Was vegas fun?
Are you back and recovered?
Too strong
Y'all seemed like it
How big was your group
All dudes?
Lol
Wait I thought the girl didn't come?
But it was her friends?
Ah
Dude lol. Aki invited calvin to go out to that bar for his bday

There's actually a large population of African Chinese
Yeah
But when the mining industry was big a lot of Chinese immigrated
My parents have a lot of Chinese friends in Angola lol
Ummm more than half a century. I forget exactly though
No
I've never been to Africa
It's too hard for me to get a visa
*visa to Angola not Africa

Ohhhhhhhh
Cat rejected me
No response
I'm sad they didn't ask meowt
I was pawsitive we would be a good match
Lollll
😬
They're right behind you
Wine night
We dranked
Girls from work :)
Oooh girl
No.
It's weird he wants to grab dinner
Bc like.
Why would you not ask a girl out until a week later
Unless you only wanna hook up
Should I ask?
I don't really want to go on a friend dinner
Jason
Jason
Should I ask if it's a friend dinner
I asked
Just us or wit there

Oooh that sounds fun!
I recently do :) but I don't know much about it.
Are you a coffee expert?
Ooooh ty!!
I don't know how to make it from beans lol
Why can't you drink it much
Oh. Do you drink energy drinks or soda?
Oh wowwww
No redbull shots
Oh really?
Wait in general?
Or for you?
But what about the dangers of four locos
Ohhh
I like Red Bull
I love the taste of a lot of energy drinks actually lol
Im surprise though bc I thought cs people drank energy drinks
Ah
...wait how does that impact things?
Oh....wow I didn't know that.
Hmm. I think I might have that problem. But I'm not sure
I think someone once told me I have anxiety symptoms but I don't really know what those are
But I know I seem to like the taste of caffeinated things
Omg 😞 that sucks
Maybe it's a swap for your extremely high alcohol tolerance
Be real.
LOL Jason
You get Asian glow
Uhhh yes you do lol
Your face gets so red
Lol
But I didn't know you were so up north
Egypt
I know you're in Africa
In
In de Nile

But you're a guy so you can pee anywhere
I definitely think you have Asian glow though
I AM THE FRIEND NOW
Dang that's not the gif I wanted

Ryan made it! :)
Going out where lol?

Omg that's scary 😢
What happened?
Oh and jones is awesome! Great date spot I think
Looks so pretty!!!
That's so exciting!!!! Lion king pics pls
What
And he was busy Friday
Oh no. I had akis thing
So we're going to hang out Thursday.
But like idk.
I'm very torn about this bc it's like pretty clear he's like probably dating around
Dinner
He doesn't message me or try to talk to me at all in between
Like I talked to Ryan about it
It took him over a week to ask me to dinner
Idk if it's even a date
Yeah
But like no messages between
Like if I'm into someone I try to talk at least you know?
Is like...I'm pretty low priority then
Yeah
Yeah...
So. Idk.
It feel bad.
Yeah.
Yeah
*feels
Yeah but then like. Idk. We should hang out with everyone
Yeah
I agree
And if he just wants to hook up
Let's just get drinks and hook up
Yeah.
Not go to dinner
But like wtf you expect me to not have weekend plans lol
Why would you ask a girl to dinner for Saturday night on Thursday.
I feel like that's so
Dumb.
I wish I knew someone who could know and just tell me like "yo - there's a 75% chance this isn't going to happen"
Dude this isn't fun.
Dating in college was way more fun
No but the game is supposed to be fun
Yeah
But like - I don't know, but I do know I only want to participate in fun, happy things
Yeah.
Should I say smth
Not like meh, bleh shit
I don't think I'm about that life though
When we meet up
yeah
I shouldn't care so much.
You're right
Yeah. You're right.
If this was some guy I just met, I'd probably be like "hey sorry this isn't gonna work out"
Fuck.
But I can't even figure out if these meetings are dates or not
I'm thinking way too much about this
Omg. Do you think he asked me so late, for Saturday
Dude fuckkkkk that shit
Bc someone cancelled
Man. Ducking.
He's not all fucking that. Why do I have to make it such a big deal.
I always tell other girls, you shouldn't like guy who don't like you
If it already doesn't work, it's not going to work
It's a waste of time
Fuck. Why can't I take my own advice.
Everyone has been telling me this doesn't look good.
If it's super casual
Hey so how's dating going for you so far
Oh really?
Should I be like
Bc then I'll know. If he's having fun with it, I can drop it
How soon did she ask if
*it
What did you say
Oh
On average
How many people do you go out with per week
Reddit is a bad source
>.>
Ok. I should just
Shut up about this until Thursday
If Thursday isn't perfect and he still doesn't want to talk to me ever outside of it
Fine.
I will drop it.
Wait ask him what
What time of day do you usually ask girls out btw.
LOL
Is it a date
Wait if he pays for things
Yeah true
Oh
Ok
Wait what time of day
Do you usually ask girls out
Like does that indicate anything?
Like you'd ask during work
Omg what am I saying
Sorry
Ok ok ok
Ok ty Jason
Enjoy the lions T________T
I'm being dumb
>.>
I didn't see calvin
I don't think he even came
Luckily
I didn't know that they were friends
Oh he did
I didn't go to dinner lol
Wait where was the pic
Link?
lol click share
And then send in messenger
Oh that must've not been on Saturday
Bc he shared it Saturday morning
Lol it was supposed to be yesterday
But I just went to dinner
*drinks I mean
Not dinner
What time is it in Africa
Oh
Well it just came up
Bc he was messaging me a lot
Yeahhhh
Yeahhhhh
Yeah
Idk today he requested to follow me on instagram
I hope not
It felt awk bc he came over to Ryan's when ryan and I were just hanging out
And we started talking about dating and Idk. It was a bit awk.
And like he's nice but
Idk if our personalities mesh
I don't think I'm overthinking lol
I don't really think about it
Yeah. I mean I don't think anything of it
It's just that I don't think we mesh as friends yet
Yeah
Like idk if I'm on a message him every day basis...
Yeah
And when we all had dinner
No lol
I mean when he came over to hang
I felt it was meh.
Not that I have anything against him.
Like we didn't really chat then, or click
Ah ok.
Ah ok
So it seems odd that we'd joke like that online? Idk.
But like
Yeah
Ok.
Sure.
There's only two things I'm really obsessing over right now, so I can't really obsess over much else :P
I mean lol I really don't think about it at all
I think he seems friendly - I just think I had to see him around a bit more.
Oh. Yeah
He messaged me Thursday and we haven't talked since
So lol. Idk wtf that was.
I think I got dumped lol
Which I'm ok with bc we went on 4 dates and he didn't try to make a move
He would text me nearly every day to ask how my day was
Like a couple texts back and forth everyday
And I just didn't text back
But like. I felt like he wasn't interested really so I didn't feel the need to
Ah
Like I asked him Wednesday night
And he responded Thursday morning
Yeah but if he was into it, I would've messaged me again
Like, he's busy during his rotation
And then
He has time off where he watches basketball VODs
lol I don't think so
I just don't think he's interested
And he didn't ask me about my weekend plans or set up a next meeting
And it's not like I've hyped him up like I unfortunately did with jason
And texts me like every half hour if even
So if he's not totally into me, I don't need to like check in to make sure
I mean I asked him out last time
Lol is it?
I don't think it's a huge expectation to have him text me
Yeah basically
We did like every day yeah
But not like conversations
Like - I probably message Ryan and you more than any guy lol
I think so
Bc I'm chatty lol
Like if a guy is trying to be cool or not
Yeah it's hard to tell
But like - I want a guy who can eventually be clingy
Haha me toooo
Bc it's not cool
But it's hard bc I know they can't be initially clingy lol
Yeah. So how can I find the ones that are secretly so
Oooh good point
Oh bc you don't like them
lol I've been trying to be chill
But secretly no chill
Idk Jason
Haha ofc
Yeah
I feel bad now though lol
K have funnnnn
K come back safe!
Should. I say hi just in case
True
😬
I just don't want to think I misunderstood
Take lots of pics
So cute!
Ugh
Welcome
Working on my day off
Back to civ
Oooh have funnn
That's so derp
There is no pyramid emoji 😞
Hahahaha
Lol no why
OH like in the past lol
Yeah!! :)
Yayyy
But let's do it somewhere warm
Jason - let's plan bonfire asap when you get back. We need to get fire stuff
😬
😍
OMG!
That's so cool
Camel so tall
How did you get on lol
How tall?
Omg so cute
Do they spit
Omg I want to pet a camel now
Like llamas
😬
It's ok - show when you back
Maybe we should wine instead of bonfire lol
*bonfiring
But we are no firing?
No it's next weekend
O ok
V v v soon
Ryan is in Austin next weeeknd
No next next weekend is Ryan's thing
Omg her bio is unbearable though
Dude
Are you looking to hook up
If so
Something punny about her bio I guess
Hey girl - if that's the case, let's treat all our convos like they're the last 😉
🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆
👅👅👅👅💦💦💦
Keep it classy
And then
Did you use my pickup line
Hi
Are you still African
And the mall
Omg so fun!!!
Go explore
And go on a night ferry across to the markets!!!!
Do Burj Khalifa
Oh....lol idk
I'm sure there are a lot of clubs open lol
My layover was in the afternoon
Oh....hydrate better then and don't drink
Yeah it's nice
Do smth luxury though so you can say you did :)
Nice.
LOL.
Lol. Idk.
Go look.
But seriously that girl's bio though lol
Wait. Do all girls have like a sexy photo?
Like if Allan had a sister
lol actually that girl looks kind of like Allan.
??
Yeah, idk.
I actually don't get that either
Does he maybe think that he shouldn't pay bc it's his thing?
Lol maybe just re-request him
Maybe that though
Yeah...me neither but I'm also poor
That's really awk of him to do that.
I guess.
But I get what you mean
>.>
No I think it's not weird you would not want that. It's very reasonable
Yeah.
Lol, but that sucks bc you shouldn't have to
Yeah
It's ok. You don't have to pretend to like Nature
Lol.
Especially with me
No
I'll keep it a secret
😬
I actually don't. Like that's why I decline camping
That's a good one haha
LOL
I actually laughed
LOL
No. I'm about to thrones
Are you doing anything fun in Dubai
Lol
Oh. That's too bad. I think you guys should leave the airport
Did you not have a layover last time you were there?
Dude you missed out
Dubai so prettyyyy
Babies.
When you wanna do wine night?
I have lots of gossip
LOL. Well I'm getting dinner with a friend Tuesday but I can prob do after too.
So far I'm free all days of the week
But I'd prefer wed/tues
You?
LOL
Do you have wine or should I bring a wine
That alcoholic...
Kk
Oooh yayyyy
Kk lmk
My week is stupid busy 😞
Hey let's do Wednesday
*Tuesday late
Is that ok with you? Like maybe at 9 lol.
How soon do girls respond to your tinder messages
Do you then not message he r
If a girl takes a long time to respond
For a while to match pacing
Ugh.
Idk. It's dumb
I don't understand dates. I don't understand pacing.
I can see how people end up forever alone.
Ughhh I'm so mopey todayyyy
Hi
Ugh
Aw :)
😬
Omg that's so cute
:) tyyyyyyyy
The toddler poop pet
LOL gross
CANT WAIT FOR OUR WINE NIGHT
Fitting
Ooh. I like reds
Much diversity
It's so cold lately
Is bonfire a good idea this weekend
Ok
As long as we bring good blankets :)
I love dogs
And cats
Hehe yes
Potty training takes a bit. Maybe a month or two
Omgggggg
And def puppies are way harder
Omg wait are you serious?
I think it's harder for an apartment
Maybe you should try to foster first!
Omg!!!
A little...
It's like you help take in a shelter dog
So you can free up the space in the shelter
You can! But it's less permanent up front
And a lot of times they don't want fosters to adopt so they can keep fostering
And you home them until they're adopted
Or get a cat :3
Oh 😞
I don't like babies that much lol
I love cats and dogs
Like my maternal instinct kicks in super hard
Like so much lol
Lol cats aren't like that. They just don't love people blindly
But when I see animals, I'm like -- setting rules and bedtimes and training
I feel like a dog is a huge step. It's like having a baby
What's making you want a dog?
Oh
Then why now?
LOL.
Don't pick a breed
And by pretrained do you mean potty trained? A lot of dogs age 1 or older are potty trained
Adopt! Don't shop! :)
If you really like a breed, there are breed rescues
A lot of shelters let you play with them and meet with them
Then you should just go to shelters and look
Yay ^^
Well - a lot of shelter dogs will be mixed
Lol
I think the SFSPCA will have more dogs
If you ever want to go - I can come with you! I only know the city shelter though bc I cat volunteer there
Yeah
Mk
UGH. I'm so single.
I never understood the struggle until now
This is so hard. Being single. Its like constantly in the back of my mind and I can even watch anime or worry about work without also thinking about how single I am
Omg it's been 4 months only.
UGHHHHHHHHHH
But I'm so alone lol
It's more like...I don't feel comfortable
It's so weird.
Just being alone
But I don't have anyone I want to be with. I just am not used to coming home to no one
How to be single
Yeah
Yeah. I know.
Haha
But it's harddd
Yeah. I knowwwwe
Ever
They get caught up in life and just never meet the right person
>.> bleh
-.-
Like
Some people never meet people again
T______T fine
Yeah that makes sense lol. It's basically everything I already know but I still want to complain about it
Like word vomit
Lol nah.
But I do need to chill and not be so antsy about being alone
I don't believe that since I've already had the kind of relationship I want
Ah yeah.
I wish I had a cat.
😿
>.>
🐫
Amazon priming it rn
K.
Lol wtf
Are you home now?
I just finished my thing
K I'm not home eat but I'll just come up
Wanna start early
🐫

Omggggg
Jason check when he was last online
Plan ruined
Saying sorry he didn't respond that he had to go get staples in his head
So I had to respond - and just be like wth, are you ok
He messaged me at like 1 something am
So I'm sure he's staying home just resting up today
But like holy shit
....I probably should delay that convo
I know right
Yeah
Yeahhhh
Yeahhhhhhhhh
But like damn. Hope he's ok
LOL.
Ew holy shit
Omg you post too fast
:
I wanted to say
What did the janitor say when he jumped out of the closet?
🐫
Ok but yeah I agree
Wait link me the thread
I LOVE GOSSIP
Lol
Crazy girlfriends
So I did a crazy thing today
Wait do you think we're....
Like you know when people are like "don't stick your dick in crazy"
I looked up calvin and I's chat history
And I think if I have "boyfriends" to tie me over
But like. I'm pretty sure that's crazy of me to do.
And it was def more double sided but I analyzed it a bit lol
I can seem less crazy for the like #goals guys
To see how that started off
We should reach out to ppl about food today
And blankets
Trueee
Idk when
What's tomorrow
Oh lll
And girls messaged me today ><
I can't have a thinggg
WHY DO I LET THESE BEAUTIFUL MEN PLAY WITH MY EMOTIONS
Like saying it's going to be a blast :3
It's like conversational :)
I thought his last response was cute
He told me he's been to an impromptu bonfire
DAMMIT
#REKT
Shit
LOL really?

😢
It's a bad weekend for my friends 😞 a lot have family visiting or are out of town
But actually it's ok bc I think too many people is bad for one fire lol
We should've kept original date
I think 10 people is a good size for being around a fire
You didn't say at first it was bc ryan lol
Rude
No you said it after we changed it lol
:)
Oh do we?
Yeah you guys sneaked that
It's fine though!
Maybe like 15
And my friend is coming

ALL THESE SEXY MEN WANTING TO BE IN A DEEP COMMITTED RELATIONSHIP WITH ME

Man. Talking to Albert is kind of not fun :/
*dating
He just guilt trips me a lot about the satin thing
Is the name Sah-teen spelled Satin
Satin cloth?
Oh how do you know
Yeah.
I want to stop talking to him rn. But like I can't without it being like I'm ignoring him and he's coming on Friday
You sure
Not responding
Ugh
I have a hard time
Even when I don't want to
Fuck. He responded to it
This escalated super quick.
Wtf. Is ari involved
Tfti
🐫
>:x
Ooh glhf!
Haha
2manyKatherine
Omg....Albert -.-"
Yes sir
Woah.
Dude.....
Ugh. Ok like don't talk to Albert about it
Dude. It's too much.
But like.
And he linked me a motivational YouTube
But like don't talk to him about it
I think it will make it worse
Yeah it seems like it? Idk
It's ok. He's getting it all out I think
Oh who
Ok.
He said a lot of stuff now
Ok. 100% is it not me
And relate
But I don't want to be like "dude it's ok"
Oh
Bc I want to say things to comfort him
Yeah he's been ranting for a while about relationship stuff
Ok nvm then
I just want him to know this happens to everyone and that he's not alone in it
New hobby
LOL
🐫
I was just about to say
Yay food!!!
It's at 7 right?
I have to be somewhere at 8, but it's close
Natoma Cabana?
😞
No
Just some guy
I'm just like meh now
Idk. I don't really want to date around anymore lol.
The novelty has already worn off
Lol.
Just idk.
Idk i don't have high hopes bc we didn't even joke around much
Maybe dating for looks is shitty
Corgicon?
And no banter
But I think I'm learning what I definitely don't want
I seriously don't know what I want
It's weird bc I see him like a baby bc I was an org mom
Man. There's this like kid. He's only 24, and he went to my college and recognized me from the org I led.
I want that.
But not in the form of a baby
But he's funny and has witty answers
I don't care about smart even though
Like that's it
Let's just laugh and have fun
Like wtf do I need someone that smart for
I'm not trying to start a business...
It's not even that
Like I've never met someone so stupid I can't have a discussion about topics I want
Idk. Anyway.
Like only here in SF have I ever heard people say "oh they have to be smart"
Sorry I feel like sometimes when I go against something, I go too hard
Smart is good. It's just I don't see it impact relationships nearly as much as other factors
Yeah. Not that I think it's bad quality to look for!
Yeah and how people treat others
Idk. Maybe
Mehhhhhh
Lol
Yeah sure. I'll come get boba
Maybe
Oooh
I need to marry me an uber employee and get divorced
Dang.
Why
That's extremely generous to me
Or do a prenup
lol yeah that was the point
I wish there was a more universal term for men that was the equivalent of "bitches"
SIGH
You don't have to be smart to be rich lol. Look at our idiot president
You say that. How many guys would say trump is smart enough to date
Trump probably can't locate countries on a map that he's been to.
And nah, dicks isn't the same
"Mo dicks, mo problems" is not true lol
Everyone is "smart" in some way
Yeah
No yeah
So sad
Man bitches
Omg most athletic pug
When??
Lol yeah. I'm going. With Ryan.
LOL.
No idea
Are you just driving there?
Wait how were you going to invite me and then ryan drive
Your car has 2 seats
Lol I think he just wanted to troll you
Oh 😞 yeah that doesn't sound like it's fun
Sorry I didn't know much about it - I thought it was a joke between you guys 😞
Yeah...I can see that
He's cool
Yeah. I like hanging out with ari actually
I don't mind his quirkiness
Haha you're like his big brother
Wow
But that's a great quality
That he can improve
Jeez really?
That's like my ex.
😞
Anyone can.
Yeah haha
Maybe it's a self esteem thing
Not everyone eventually will
SAME
But I think you guys are a bit harsh sometimes picking on him
Not like all the time, but sometimes small comments
Yeah. Just like sometimes here and there
Not all the time obviously! :)
I can tell y'all are close like that
Caterpillars
lol why
??
Yeah. I will cry and start panicking and cannot be reasonable or calm about it
I'm also afraid of moths and butterflies
Since I was 7 Oreo
I used to be 7 oreos
*or so
But death isn't one of them
Can I come early if I need to
I want to get off work
What're y'all doing

Spiritually.
Man I realized how fucking bad my Asian thing is
My yellow fever
What is it then
Oh. Ok
Despite him being half
I was so turned off at how non Asian this guy was and how non Asian he looked
Now
My life would be complete
If I could just have that
But with cats
But it feels so good to get love from normally non clingy ones, that become clingy
CATS
Bc dogs are like clingy boys. They're nice.
Aka
This was a weird metaphor I regret typing out
Haha
Yeah same
Lol
So true 😢
:')
You toooooo
A lot of girls I know have said you're cute btw
Like 2 girls I know
And then my friend Julia when she came to visit
Yeah
Even though she's hot
But you weren't interested
My coworker who is married
My coworker saw you in my photos lol
Yeah lol
But why she's so cute
It's weird
Oh
I think she's pretty but in college
Yeah
It was super hit or miss for her at parties
Weird though
Yeah
I think I'm the same way. I'm hit or miss for people
And very miss to girls lol
Lol. No like attractiveness
And a LOT of people don't think I'm fun. I think I'm too intense for some people
And it confuses them if I get hit on
Yeah. Girls think I'm ugly lol
Huh
Idk about this
Maybe video quality
Haha sure! I'll get snacks and host since you hosted wine night
Yay!!
Haha it's nice
I like my couch.
I fall asleep on it a lot
Like last night I fell asleep on my couch, and got up at 5 am to wash up and move to my bed
I love it though
Nah dude I bought it
Super pricey too. Like almost $500
No regrets
And you can pretend you're still sleeping
LOL. I'll baby carry you up
Like how parents do
Yeah. My arms get tired just trying to French braid my hair
I need to pump some iron
LOL.
Wait what group is Puerto Rico
Who was in for Puerto Rico
Oh ok
I have noon plans, so let's just meet for Thrones. Maybe food? We can like get takeout
But Ryan's not here Sunday right?
Oh shoot. Hmm.
OOH YEAH.
Maybe we should postpone thrones? We can watch it a bit later?
Ooh jealous!
Let's do thrones later if possible. I think I need some alone time to cook this weekend :)
Mm idk. Let's chat Sunday
Abt it
I dont think I'm handling it well from a mental well-being perspective
My work is very stressful lately.
Haha yeah ok.
Yeah. I just had a meeting with my managers
I think I'm doing 3x the work of other people
But if I say I'm unhappy about it , they think I'm being negative
And I'm being given way more bigger roles
Without them taking me off any
Idk what to do.
Im really struggling to keep this up. Idk. And it's rough not to have someone. Which is why I think I was excited at first about being single
And now I feel like lost. Because work has been hell and I just keep it in to myself.
And they just make empty promises
I've talked to them
I've been in this situation for 2 months already
When I know I can succeed and I'm watching others judge me for failing when I just can't take on more.
And today they were like "we'll get you support quick. Maybe in 3 months"
I feel really sad. Because i think it's setting me up to fail
I'm so sorry to like pour all this out on you
I just don't know what to do.
I'm hiding in a conference room right now and I just feel really trapped.
I know I should...
And I can't handle the situation emotionally right now
It's just I don't want to fail anyone
I haven't been able to study outside of work.
Idk.
Because I've had to take that time to work instead
So it's also preventing me from developing and finding a new job
I usually study on the weekends
Like a few hours
I'm emotionally drained
But I haven't had the energy to do work and study
I'm so bad at handling this situation
I know. I'm just not good enough yet for the job I want though
I need to pick the right one or it could hinder my future
And because I've been trying to shift careers
And I have to be strategic about it because I signed a new lease, I just spent a lot from the breakup
I can't just pick up any job
And I need to build out more side protecta
I want to go into data or user research. But a lot of them require quant degrees. And since I don't have one, I have to study a lot to prove I can do those things. So I take a lot of classes
I can't.
I kind of was crying and I don't want anyone to know.
I can't leave the room right now.
*projects
I'm up for promotion. But if I fail all this, no promotion.
I can't.
Idk
But they've been declining my meetings
I don't know.
But I requested it at the beginning of august...
My managers won't talk to me about it until EOM
Yeah it's fine. I think just, I want to take some time this weekend to think
I should quit and focus on studying
I think if at EOM, if I don't get promoted...
And get a new job.
Yeah...
Have you assigned stuff for tomorrow?
Should we play like beer games? Let's get some ciders for ppl who hate beer
And what drinks
Wait who is smores

I feel like I'm making bad life decisions
And yesterday, I probably ate like 2000 calories no lie
My stomach went from taut to flab in one night
Oh. Maybe more than 2000
And how often is actually reckless
Yes
Like. How often do you do reckless things in your life
How often is normal

So. Yup. My life.
Too late. I already did it

No. I asked jason for Thursday plans.
My thinking is that i think he's ok just to BS with as friends
I don't want to ruin my chances with girls if I had any to begin with. So it's more scary to ask him
So that's kind of fun.
I don't think so. If he's like nah
*?
Then I think it will help me move on
From him at least.
Just
Thursday plans!
Or even worse
I mean like.
I'm going to ask about drinks after that if he doesn't send me an awkwardly apologetic note about not being interested
LOL.
"archived"
Really)
Like I just want a friend who I can treat like a temp boyfriend until I can find my real boyfriend
Like even a once a week boyfriend
Bc like that's all I want from jason. And I'm not getting it
LOL jk I don't want to spoil the camel emoji!
Like just hanging as friends.
Which was the doctor until he's got into his intense inpatient rotation
Just attention
I want girls to care lol
That's what I want
Oh then yes
Oh
?
Or like
🐫
Nothing serious esp with jason
No that's what I want in a real boyfriend
Not jason
Well. Let's see.
It's the fact that I wrote this whole thing in case girls texts me
It's fine. It's not him who I'm worried about.
And he hasn't texted me today. Or yesterday.
And I know he doesn't care but gaifinensuandnoaisubsiaoxuwnlsnfens
Yeah.
No to jason
No I wrote up this thing for girls
It's like. What to text him if he texts me again and it's not asking me out
But I end it in a smiley
lol it's a little Afro
Yeah.
*ness
*aggro
To diffuse the aggro-mess
So. There's that.
LOL. But you're not going to agree with it.
And not, Jason logical
It's very like...Katherine sassy
LOL.
Idk if that's too...like is the last line too passive aggressive friendly?
But I doubt it. I just dream about it.
Idk. My dream is that I'll say that and he'll respond with a date time and place.
If he ever fucking texts me again
A girl can only dream
Are you making anything for Ryan's BBQ?
Lol why were you like
Then
Ohhhhh noooo
When is it
Let's go to museum
Ohhhh
Idk. Maybe I will just bring corn
Selfishly
Or maybe make smth?
Freeloaders
Dude he should charge for food lol
Oooh omakase?
Wait. Did you buy that?
DID I TELL YOU ABOUT THAT
I want a footbath!!!!
I WANT ONE
OMG
Oooh expensive
LOL. Are you trying it now?
Jealous
Niceeeee
I've never tried
Yup. Just seen my parents use it haha
I want to try
And omg you are so on top of my events lol
I deleted CMB
Trying to improve my life lol
I had a date. It went really well. The guy is super nice.
Idk
I still texted girls.
girls is going to Seattle.
It's unhealthy
I sat there for a bit like wtf why do I care
I don't know why I have all these things I can be doing to improve my life. And I still do the things that are crappy
Just to see if he had Thursday plans.
Yeah. Because he just he didn't like ask what's up
And that like triggered me lol
Idk
Or say anything else about following up
And he responds he's going to Seattle
Like why would that trigger me
It was dumb
Ughhhhh
And I met someone really funny and nice. So why did I not text him after but texted girls
What the fuck is wrong with meeeeee
So now I think I'm going to slowly just. Stop. So since I didn't have any active convos on CMB. I just deleted it.
But like I only had one date with girls
>< man what makes me mad is that I knew that. Like after the date I knew he wasn't going to ask me out again
But then he kept texting me, which threw me off
Haha I know right
And it's SO DEGRADING to be like "I'm down"
And now I'm so into like anything with him. Even though I know he's not down
I think it's just to have a backup on weekends where he's out and drunk
Ok ok
No more girls talk.
Do you think we're going to do board games or nah?
:x
I knowwwwww
Or maybe we can do drinks and games
Like at the foundry

Idk what to say now.
Isnmskwodusbvwiwodjwnusnsosos

So he had to clarify what he's asking
Maybe just question mark?
Idk.
Ooooh
That might be good
Trueeee
This is like jumanji

autocorrect turns Jumanji into humankind
No game, no life

Super not healthy lol
OMG
Haha that's cool. Free food is free food.
Your last dinner was so yummy!
!!!! Oh no!!!!
Man good thing we're not having spicy noodles this week
Get that numbing stuff
Like for cold sores
Non
At least that's what calvin used and my coworker used
It's a liquid
And it kind of helped
I've used it before when I bit the side of my cheek really hard
Ok. Be ready for spicy next week tho
Getting played
LIFE
You?
Just gym'd
Doin work
Fun
??
Do you have to pick a date
If you don't - can you get me one?
Ok
I have a meeting
Uhhhh let's do a Sunday just in case
Yay!!!!
UGH my timing is so bad
Man I'm so pecking
Idk where link is
*peckish
Saw you guys are hiring for UX researcher
Nah I'm not there yet
Gotta build a portfolio
Haha ok
Oh sure!
UGH jelly
I gotta finish this work thing
But I'll ping you abt it later!
Wait lol why is our visit time at 9 pm
Dang
Oh lol
Dawwwww!!!
No! I want!!!
I want that dog
So cute!!!!
Please introduce me to the dog tomorrow
Or lmk when I should come so I can maximize dog action
Haha ok. I'll just come hang
Ooooh yeahhhhh
Ugh
But that's still cool
Oh and you're by Chinatown now right?
Oh fuck I forgot I'm on diet
Idk.
Ummm, idk. Until I feel like it's worth lol
Btw if a guy asks you out for a Friday. Is that a good sign?
Like that he's willing to risk a Friday
It's like a tiny thing right?
Oh
Ok.
>.>
I'm like pretty sure he has a date Thursday
girls
But I'm trying to justify it by saying Friday is still a risk
I wanted a weekend date
I don't have plans Tuesday night yet lol. But I didn't want to be a Tuesday date.
He said Seattle. I didn't respond.
I didn't have to
He asked me what my week looked like next week.
I asked him his Thursday plans
I feel like he knows I'm trying to play the game though
And he is just playing me better. Like responding right away to some of my texts to get me to respond, and then going cold until the next morning.
Idk. I feel like he knows.
But like. I think he knows things other guys don't
UGH. SO GOOD.
I need like a spirit guide
How do guys get so good...
And ask me on the date if I want to see him again
Maybe I need to read a player book
FUCK I GOT PLAYED SO HARD
Like why send me such a sweet text after the date
Although he's cool and I feel like we have chemistry, I'm cool to hang or not
Like yanking away usually just makes me care less. Like with the doctor
It's fine
And if we text one every other day
But like. It was the only date that I was like...school girl over
Like I hyped up jason so much and I still haven't ever school girled over it
Well girls didn't yank per se.
Idk
Maybe
Jason yanked too lol
I think he's just super smooth and I've never been played before so this is all very new to me
>.>
It's like the crying in a Ferrari or happy on a bike thing
Back up chick
Attention
Would you be a billionaire's side chick or a poor dudes main chick
Except money = charisma in this case
He's great.
Dude you didn't go on a date with him
LOL. No
Man. I want to ask another player .
Like I think ignoring his texts is the best. But I wonder if I should introduce like....jealousy
Idk if that would work
I need to crush the competition
For advice
Marry him and get divorced
Jk lol
Make him fall in love with me until I find someone better
The unrealistic dream is he changes for me. But I know. I know....#justgirlthings
I have something maybe at 10/11 lol sorry
Ah ok 😕
😕
I don't want to make anyone mad
It's a little intense lol bc I don't read these things well

Have they kissed?
Ah
That's quite the run isn't it?
Awww
Maybe he's just shy to make the first move??
Maybe Jason has too much
I need to learn patience
LOL
I think I need to stop making first moves all the time
LOL
Maybe you did!
How do you usually make a move?
You do seem pretty tall lately
No really what is your big move
LOL.
Noice
What're you bringing to BBQ?
Ohhh

Ah idk ><
Haha maybe...

Should we film it? Or is that social media overkill
Or Snapchat? Idk
Wait but that's not part of the challenge
Ahhh idk how we should do it
Like go Facebook live?
Haha ok
Still probably shouldn't drink in the next few days
I think I still have a little something but it's no biggie now haha

About Jenny
Lol yeah I can tell
No what
Why'd he pay
Man. It's
I think you told me
Ohh
So easy to see how girls can spiral into this dark thing over guys
But man it's a fine line before crossing into crazy girl territory.
Lol is it bad I sympathize with her? Not that I think ari did anything wrong...
I can't believe he paid
What was the reasoning there?
Yeah
Wait why did they go to strip club if she's poor
Wth.
For other insecurities.
I think it's probably a confidence developed out of a defense mechanism
Yeah :/
Lol what did you have for dinner
But am thinking of getting dessert lol
Bc I'm being fat
I ate noodles
LOL
That's real fat
lol that's normal
#RealFatHasCake
I might go get cake lol

Yay! Yeah I want to go clubbing or something dressy
I thought I was going to have that thing with girls but it's Monday and no response yet lol. Guess it's for the better.
It's ok. It's the universe trying to help me out.
But I'm open to suggestions
I like temple lol
Yeah....

Dang
Already?
More rude girls
Let's invite Jacqueline and Robin :)
I'm so rude
Fucking,
Guy.
This.
LOL.
Yeah. Maybe he forgot to bring a charger.
Or maybe he went into a coma
I don't remember the first time I went to Seattle
🐫
That was the joke lol
Um it was SO FUNNY
Or do my jokes give you life
Are you ded yet
LOLOL
Just had my chat at 3...
But. Idk if my work load will go down
It felt a lot better
And that she still wants the op to be there for me if I want it or get better in 3-6 months
She said she understood and wants to help
But knowing my manager is more understanding already lifts a huge burden off my chest
Yeah....but she seemed genuine.
Or I am too trusting of words
And a lot of it was alleviated bc I worked a full day on Sunday lol
But I don't want to do that
Yeah. I think the work anxiety was the worst part for me
Idk. Something smart
lol seriously help me craft a response to girls tonight though
Something like.
No
LOL
If you ever want to see me again. I want to see you grovel.
No idea!!!
I want to see a cute guy grovel
If not, something sarcastic and witty
Or get a really nice free dinner
*other plans
Oh Man or like
"Oops, wasn't sure if you'd died or not, so I already made plans for Friday"
LOL.
?
Considering all the pain I went through thanks to him
Yeah. But a grovel would mean a lot to me
And make him insecure about his womanizing abilities
lol I don't think he will
The only way I can get him to grovel is hurt his pride
Yeah
That's too not cool for him
And he's too cool
Like
Man. He's so smooth
Or too good
lol nvm
Hahahaha
LOL.
I can't be like "huh?"
Lol this isn't IRL
Nah. I want to send something snappy
Like I thought of this in a minute.
I like it.
I mean. I thought of it in a minute
LOL. Sorry. I thought you died so I made other plans for Friday.
Just
I just want free food from a player.
I'm free for dinner next Tuesday though.
LOL. Maybe not the dinner part.
.....idk
You weak around the boyz too 😉
OMG HAHAHA that gif
How is malaria transmitted between humans
Omg nooooo
Ohhh nice
SAFU
Lol. safe-fu
Esque
Like the anime
Nvm.
Ok.
How many days can I have curry in my fridge
Boooooooooooo
Booooooo
And have it be safe to eat
Oh nice. Ok good
Heck naw
🐫
🐫
Kk
LOL.
😞 sorry. How come?
Hope you figure it out soon
😞 that sounds sucky though
?
Hmm, yeah.
😕 yeah.
As much as you reach out for other stuff haha
And you're there for a lot of us
Nah.
So don't feel like you can't reach out whenever you know?
You should always have someone to talk to about things
Everyone understands if you're just like "had a bad day"
And then talk about stuff
Yeah sorry 😞
Yeah. His advice was stemming from something totally different
So he had no context
I think ryan was being a bit aggressive about it bc I wasn't making good life choices lately, but this wasn't supposed to be so intense
And you're the only one I talk to about it
Yeah.
??
Me too.
But the thing is it's nice you're more relatable
Yeah...
That's something I think ryan might have a hard time with.
You can be more empathetic and compassionate
Well. I think Ryan's like that bc he has his own inner demons
Yeah I think everyone has those struggles which is why we can all mostly sympathize
I don't think he's all 100% happy like he says
They want to know you're safe
But I think that's just what parents say though. Like at a certain point
😕 I'm sorry that happened to you
If you're being healthier and growing now, it can be better in a different way
But hey - nothing ever ends up the same as it was in the past.
Well if it's a philosophy that everyone always looks down on in favor of being competitive
I'm sure there are things about you now that you wouldn't trade though
I don't get what's wrong with just being happy.
Yeah. I mean I get wanting to be better
I feel like it's not right
Yeah 😞
But I think if you want it, you still have it in you.
But I think you recognizing it and what you want is good
Yeah. I think I can relate.
And being tired
To kind of acknowledge the difference I guess between being lazy bc you want to
Don't say that!
*not
Haha
Aw Jason!
You shouldn't look down on average people - but you're definitely my average
Not my average
You have an abnormal positivity that I think attracts a lot of people
Weird typo
Anyway
*NOT average
And I can tell you're really smart. And not in the ways that people here circle jerk about it.
You just have to know the strengths you've developed since the time you think back to
Haha
I think what trips people up a lot is this concept of self
Yeah. I'm sure you're way better in a lot of aspects now
You have strengths you developed that you should see as who you are
And a lot of people don't see that their definition is ever evolving. And that sometimes you're not an eevvee anymore so you can't focus on how great your Take-Down was. You are past using Take-Down. You're a jolteon now
Not think that the differences between now and the past are necessarily weaknesses
Ofc it's not wrong to think about it. I just hope you have positive things to look forward to as well
Idk.
No regrets Jason! It will only give you wrinkles :)
The stress of telling my manager alone helped
Of course! Anytime.
Like even though work probably won't get better for me
Sometimes it's just nice to get things off your chest too
Yeah. So at least I hope talking can help you a bit :)
Yeah not always
LOL
I'm glad :)
Haha no worries
You'd understand the struggles of talking to boyfriends at times
Yeah.
Why girls get so frustrated haha
Omg help though
I got myself into a mess
Ahhhh noooo
But stopped
Lol
Ooh he cancelled the third response
He didn't text me at allll
fuckkkkkk
Like he was typing a third message
LOL
Fuck.
I'm laughing so hard right now bc you were so right
Right?
I can't just let him have the upper hand bc he says like 1 or 2 nice words
LOL
LOL
Yeah.
Fuck.....
Or want to eat Korean food with meeee
Why did I even say that
But what if he will change lol
But
Hahahaha
Omg

Do you think he misworded
T___________T
But like his wording
Hahaha I'm so dumbbbbb
"Not just looking for a hookup"
I mean. I'm think I can get out
Idk ><
Idk. I know you and everyone logical and smart will say no
But
Fuckkkkk
Should I just try
If I want out
Yeah 😞 but what if he was out with friends
And that's the only context I have of him in person
Because our first date was like magical 😞
Yeah
Ok
Ugh
In person
I felt like we had super good chemistry
Alaidjsnsnap
You're so right
But idk.
I don't think just anyone smooth can pull that off right?
Can they?
I was so happy.
Idk. Like thrilled?
Just
Idk.
Hahaha
Fuckkkk
Like I obsessed about jason forever
LOL. I know right
Why'd he have to text me again
Like I was so stupid happy after our date
And like nowhere near as
Like how could he care so much and ask such thoughtful questions
What did we even talk about
Like about what I was like as a kid idk
*drank on dates
Yeah
Because no one ever asks that
In the way he did
lol I've drank on dates
But I've been drunk on dates
Maybe I was drunk.
And he just stops and suddenly asks me
It's like out of a fucking romcom
Like we weee talking about smth stupid and shallow or joking
*by
Idk
And the way he asked if I though we'd see each other again
Fuck I'm like convincing myself my reminiscing
Ughhhhhhhhh
But like. It was so fun. Why not again
Idk. I can't look through our old texts but like I remember he texted me at least every other day?
Idk is that nice?
Yeah. But maybe he was trying to be cool?
Lol
Except for these recent few days
I mean jason messages me less
Yeah but we aren't dating
But like maybe it's my fault bc I also text guys like once or twice a day max at first?
Like I set a bad pace?
><
Unless they're persistent
Lol
Ugh
No I mean I get it. I was mad at Sansa for season 1-6.9
Now I need to know this girls name
Yeah. Like he made me forget about jason
Like. I was no nerves for jason bc of girls
No his date was before jason
But like what if he is
I am trying to justify
This so hard
And I've noticed lately I laugh a lot easier than I used to
And not for bro reasons hahah omg
Ok but like no lie we had good chemistry and he's the only one that made me like genuinely laugh on a date
What is wrong with me
Like jason lol. We only laugh for bro reasons
LOL wait no
Dude no!!!!
I don't want a boyfriend right now
Wait no we're not debating relationship yet!
And it's not girls and not jason
Like.
lol he's someone who actually has chill and texts me every day. His name is Vincent.
But like
There's this guy. Only one. That I'm considering really.
But like I know I'm just gonna chill being single right now
But he texts me every day and keeps wanting to schedule the next date. It's so new lol.
I haven't said anything bc no problems with him
Well he's also gone in VA for the next 2 weeks lol
Yeah
He was my last date before I deleted all my apps
So.
He responds like almost right away sometimes.
Like last Monday?
Great
And if it was
And if it wasn't - we have mad chemistry lol fuck what am I saying
I learned and got played and I have a good story
I kind of want to go out wth girls again to see if it was a fluke
But idk.
Ugh
Find out?
Lol what
Foot bath is best bath tbh
HHaha he doesn't like foot bath?!
Only if you have magazines and get to eat
Btw have you been to Flying Falafel
Actually change my mind
Foot bath > bath bath
Hahahaha
But foot bath eating sounds even better
Full bath eating can get complicated
Lol
LOL
hahahahaha what is that
LOLOLOL
Haha but no I had it once
Forgot about I
Was really blown away
*it.
After work
We should get dinner there next week
And just walked by it omw home
If you are ever bored of free food
Dawwwww!!!!
LOL.

Thinking about going to sleep
Meh
But no place is open
I want ice cream 😞?
Hurts
😢
Yeah
Idk I didn't check eats
And I want to be skinny for the weekend
It's expensive though
*yhing

Lol jk.
.......><
I mean I do feel dumb
Good?
Ughhhhh
And?
What happened?
*tipsy
Yeah.
It was like jason and I
Like opposite
Yeah. I was def more drunk than he was
I think
I keep making it seem like I was wasted
I prob wasn't as smooth
Yeah sorry I was in meetings
LOL.
But I see your point
The magic I felt might not be felt by him
You know what's dumb
Yeah
I should've switched it
And emotional someone else
But
Yeah.
And no one else
Like hook up buddy w girls
I fall really hard for personalities
But I got emotionally attached first to girls 😞
GET RICHHHH

Idk can you tell?
HAHAHA
I can get really bitchy and mean. Idk if anyone except calvin knows that side of me here
SHARK KING?
*aggro lol
I think you seem super nice now
LOL
Not you mistyped it
Yeah but not snarky
Makes it even better
Hahahaha I just realized I misread it
Lol but from calvin though right
Wait do I seem like a bitch though? Like aside from when I was with calvin
Bc I wonder if people can tell I have it in me
No way
LOL
Not from like bc you see the FIRE
In my EYES
LOL
Oh
Whats 4.5
It's -4.5
Omg it's not pedantic
It's accurate
So I can't fat finger it
lol pedantic doesn't have close letters
Ok bye bye have fun at Gogi Time
That's like just normal banter haha
lol that's not snark
-.-"
Who would not like that wtf
It's like normal jokes
WTF
That's just rude
And setting your own punch line up is not clever
Like omg I was so mean
I was smarter and meaner
Like super mean
But that was my mean period
Yeah not funny
Like BITCH
This guy would like try to say stuff. And I would just be like "Will - fucking shut up."
And I'm a mean arguer
We ended up dating
my ex helped me improve a lot
But it definitely went down a bit when I was with calvin
Please. I would dust you.
Psh.
Did they go to Harvard
Omg you have a friend name Harvard
Or disappoint their parents forever
But you get it
Idk. lol that's such a lame example.
Snark is like "Man what if I asked her out though" "It's ok, we all know you never had the balls to."

Like have Aki
If we have a big enough group
Or maybe idk
And others
Yeah
Omg thank you
Thank you!!!!
?
If he sees I'm there?
Oh I don't think he will
Oh
Um
Let's walk together lol
I'm like most worried about Calvin.
Yummy
Also
And probably Robin once
Why did jacq say that abt splitting the check actually
I've only eaten with her once
But like why did Robin even bring that up
I like never ate with him except once
Oh. Why though >.>
It's just weird bc I feel like I've never hung out with them
Idk.
Ok but like lol Robin does?
Anyways just random thought.
And they hate me lol
Lol man.
Oh
Yeah I mean. I get it.
But like - I've hung out with Robin after
Idk.
Ok that's fair
It just sucks if I ever wanted to be friends with Jacqueline lol
Yeah but like pretty sure I can't now
Mk that's fair
Yeah I guess
I just thought that one thing was a bit unfair
Idk. I think it's fine.
I mean, Robin hung out with Ryan and I when we went to Polk
😕
Sorry
Oh
I guess it's fine.
Oh...no
Oh I didn't realize they were talking badly about me while I was still there
No I was just really drunk
Yeah. Idk.
Ah.
Because thats pretty mean lol
It's fine. If they're not really into hanging out it's ok. We all hang out in a big group anyway
Was I supposed to?
It's just weird to me bc Robin seems super friendly
But I think one on one is fine
But I didn't know they were saying those things so much
Yeah.
Other people we hang out with?
Like Robin has never talked to me
I think always being negative about a person in a group setting is kind of gossip/shit talking isn't it?
😕
Mm ok
Oh
And they were just trying to protect you :)
It's ok. It's probably bc I was being a bad friend
I see
So that's ok!
Don't most people?
lol I have plans tomorrow
Re:uber dinner
lol
Ohhhh
I don't mind
Lol haha are you sure it's a good idea?
I like her and I like Robin lol
